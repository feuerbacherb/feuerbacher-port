#feuerbacher-port

## Description
This is one way of how you can put your resume out on the interweb.  Thanks to the folks at Styleshout for allowing the use of their css code.

## Usage
This is a portfolio, much like the one we created earlier, but this time in React.

## Install
You see, this is a portfolio... why would you want to install it?  Read it and enjoy, possibly offer me a job?

## Testing
Not much in the way of testing was done besides on my local machine.

## Issues
The Download Resume button works locally but not on the page.  Stephen said this would not have points taken off.  By the way, right clicking on the link will allow you to view the resume, but clicking on the link does not.

Also, sending contact information to me does not work.  I disabled it because we have not gone over how to make this work.

Because we created the react repo locally first, I forgot to create it online.  Not everything went up with the initial push.  Most of the commits are local.

# The React Stuff is below this statement

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
